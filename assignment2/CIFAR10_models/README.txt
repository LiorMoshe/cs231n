You will find in this folder several implementations of classifiers for the CIFAR10 dataset implemented with tensorflow framework.
With each model we will write the final accuracy on the test set.

The main target is to set up a model that gets at leasy 70% accuracy on the validation set.
Note: We will use the function run_model that was defined in the tensorflow jupyter notebook.
